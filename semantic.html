<!--Task 1: Define the Page Structure Use semantic elements to define the basic structure of your web page, including a header, 
navigation, main content, and a footer.

Expected Outcome: A web page with a clear, logical structure, marked up with semantic elements that delineate the header, navigation, 
main content, and footer.

Task 2: Organize Content Using Articles and Sections Within the <main> element, use <article> and <section> tags to organize the content
related to your topic. Use headings (<h2> to <h6>) to title each section or article appropriately.

Expected Outcome: A semantically structured main content area, with articles and sections that logically separate different topics or 
ideas related to the main subject.

Task 3: Enhance Accessibility with Semantic Markup Incorporate additional semantic elements such as <aside> for side content, <figure> 
and <figcaption> for images, and <address> for contact information in the footer, to further enhance the page's accessibility.

Expected Outcome: A fully accessible web page that uses semantic HTML5 elements to enhance content readability and navigability, 
ensuring a better user experience and improved SEO.-->
